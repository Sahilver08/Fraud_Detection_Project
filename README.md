# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, anomaly detection using Local Outlier Factor, and supervised classification using XGBoost. Class imbalance was handled using SMOTE to improve detection accuracy. The final model was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, achieving strong performance. This project demonstrates a practical solution to a real-world problem in the financial domain.
